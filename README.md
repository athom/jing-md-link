jing-md-link
============

This is an [Alred workflow](http://www.alfredworkflow.com/) to custom uploaded image photo src link in markdown format


[Jing](http://www.techsmith.com/jing.html) provide a powerful feature is after your screenshot was uploaded into screencast.com, the image link will be paste in your clipboard. Then you can just ctrl+v to paste the image link you just uploaded. However, the link is not raw link. 

Only FTP  supports custom link format.
